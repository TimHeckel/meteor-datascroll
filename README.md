###Meteor Datascroll - Meteor Smart Package

This package includes a client solution for showing paginated subscriptions. I will soon show a full example, including how to set up your `Template` and how to declare your `publish` function server side for this pagination to work.

**NOTE:** I have discontinued development of this. Please check out [Meteor.Paginator](https://github.com/TimHeckel/meteor-paginator) instead.
